# Network-Intrusion-Detection
Developed a Machine Learning model to check the network is under attack or not.
I have used five feature selection techniques in a sequence to find the best features in the dataset.

Please download the dataset from this link http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup.data_10_percent.gz
and convert its extension to .csv
Thank you!
